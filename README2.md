# Balance board project

This project covers math and code for a balance board robot. The goal of the robot is to balance a pingpong ball on a plane using stepper motors.

A USB camera locates the ball and tracks its position

An IMU mounted on the board tracks the position of the balance board itself.

Three stepper motors controls the angle of the board with a LQR-controller
